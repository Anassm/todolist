## About this project 
<p>
  I have made this website wanting to test my general skills, it does not have any appealing functionalities nor reusable code. <br>
  Areas of improvement:
</p>

<ul>
  <li><b>Design</b> - Pages look blanq, filling empty space with elements like design patters makes it look more appealing to people.</li>
</ul>
